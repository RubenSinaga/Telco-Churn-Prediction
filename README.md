# Telco-Churn-Prediction
**Background Story:** 
One of the Chief Marketing Officers (CMO) of a company in the telecommunications industry wants to minimize the problems that often occur in his business, namely customer churn. He wants to know the habit patterns of customers who will then create machine learning models to be able to guess whether they churn or not in the next period.

Based on the problem, as a Data Analytics & Science role, make the right analysis and model to solve the project!

**This project discuss about:**

Data Reading & Cleansing
1. Exploratory Data Analysis: Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
2. Feature Engineering and Normalization
3. Machine Learning Model Comparison using K Fold Cross Validation
4. Model Evaluation
5. Machine Learning Model Result: After we compare against all classification algorithm using K-Fold Cross Validation, this project use Random Forest with 78% accuracy, 78% precision, 78% recall, and 78% f1-score.

**Conclusion** 
From analysis and modeling above, we've drawn out some points as follows:

*   The telecommunications industry sector is a competitive sector, characterized by unique differences in each customer who churns.
*   Companies can provide retention programs to some customers who have types: low tenure and low spent.
*   Implementation of the model that has been done into the system can help the marketing and sales team to segment based on the possibility of customers churning.
